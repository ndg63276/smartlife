<h2>Why can't I log in to my Smart Life / Tuya account?</h2>
I don't know i'm afraid. It appears Tuya may have changed something around the start of 2026, various people have contacted me to say they cannot log in any more
<h2>But I could log in before?</h2>
Yes, that seems to be the experience of most people. Something seems to have changed in the Tuya servers, but I have no way to know what.
<h2>Can't you look in the logs?</h2>
No, everything goes directly from your browser to the Tuya / Smart Life servers, so there are no logs for me to look at.
<h2>What if I send you my password?</h2>
That won't help, I'll get the same message as you.
<h2>I'm a developer and I think I can help?</h2>
Great, get in touch at mark<code>@</code>smartathome.co.uk.
